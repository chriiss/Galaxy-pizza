Welcome to Galaxy Pizza !
Hope you enjoy pizza :) (but who doesn’t like it?!)
This project was made with Vue.js. The objective of this project was to use Firebase as a database to store data that have been added from an admin panel.
I created a pizza-delivery site (as you may have understood called Galaxy Pizza).
Here are the functionalities covered by the project:
  -	Multi-page navigation thanks to Vue-router
  -	Add abd remove menu/pizza stored in Firebase, from the admin panel
  -	Login to the admin panel with an email and a password (the account creation is made directly from Firebase)
  -	Form creation with the library vuelidate
      o	Fields verification
      o	Fields completion according to the characters entered (for example, for the postal code, users can only enter numbers in the field)
  -	Recovery of an API, listing the cities in France and displayed through a drop-down menu, when users choose delivery at home
  -	Data storage on a JSON file to make them dynamic on Vue templates
  -	Use SCSS for the design
  -	Possibility to choose the number of pizzas to be added to the basket (the price is automatically calculated according to the number of pizzas in the basket)
  -	Use of HTML5 semantics (<title>, <header>, <section>, <footer>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>)
Unfortunately, you can’t order real pizzas but hope you’ll enjoy ;)
